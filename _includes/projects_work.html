            <p>The next release of the iQmetrix <a target="_blank" href="http://developers.iqmetrix.com">Developer Portal</a> is now available, and is an update to the initial iteration. Based on my interviews with internal development and sales teams, as well as external clients, I made the portal more flexible and to a much broader audience. </p>
            <p>For example, we used WordPress to give the Marketing and Sales teams the ability to publish their own content, as well used a three column layout for the API reference pages. </p>

            <p>The new three column API (<a href="https://github.com/lord/slate">slate</a>) layout can be found on our <a target="_blank" href="http://developers.iqmetrix.com/api">API section</a>.</p>

            <p>iQmetrix gave me the ability to practice my web development skills. My first project was to update the landing page and layout for our <a href="http://developers.iqmetrix.com">Developer Portal</a>. Once all changes and tweaks were finalized on our Github testing site, they were released onto the production site. </p>
            
            <p>I used bootstrap to help me learn and I have adapted these layouts to create a more responsive design.</p>

            <p>With this project, I started with wireframing and Photoshop, and then integrated jQuery, CSS, and HTML into the websiteâ€™s style.</p>

            <p>To publish content, we use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>, a static site generator that provides simple scripting though the nunjucks and liquid templating engines.</p>

                <p>Hey, Iâ€™m Dan, a Programmer Analyst at the City of North Vancouver. I currently hold a B.Eng in Computer Systems Engineering from <a href="http://www.carleton.ca" target="_blank">Carleton University</a>, and an <a href="http://www.bcit.ca/study/programs/6957acert" target="_blank">Applied Web Development</a> certificate from BCIT.</p>

                <p>My school and work are helping me to become a Front-End Developer by practicing Node.js, C#, SQL (Oracle and MS), and Android mobile development. I also dabble in Wed Design, such as this website which was generated in Jekyll.</p>

                <p>In my spare time, I enjoy hiking in the North Shore mountains of Vancouver and exploring the area around me.</p>

                <p>Hey, Iâ€™m Dan, an API Support Specialist at iQmetrix. I currently hold a B.Eng in Computer Systems Engineering from <a href="http://www.carleton.ca" target="_blank">Carleton University</a>.</p>

                <p>After graduation, I decided to take time off and go explore the world around me, like Europe, Asia, South America and Africa.</p>

                <p>With my role as a developer and API support technician, I'm also earning BCIT's <a href="http://www.bcit.ca/study/programs/6957acert">Applied Web Development</a> certificate to become a Front-End Web Developer. With this program, coupled with my role, I am quickly becoming a Front-End Developer while learning WordPress, Node.js. Backbone.js, SQL, and Android mobile development. I also dabble in Wed Design, such as this website generated in Jekyll.</p>

                <p>In my spare time, I enjoy hiking in the North Shore mountains of Vancouver, playing the odd video game, and exploring the area around me.</p>

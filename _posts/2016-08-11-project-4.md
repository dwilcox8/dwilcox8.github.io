description: <p>At work, I'm actively getting into a more front end development role.</p> <p>For my first front end project, I created a Chuck Norris bot that feeds Chuck Norris one-liners into the iQmetrix Slack team. This bot is based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/building-a-slack-bot-with-node-js-and-chuck-norris-super-powers" >Scotch.io Node.js Tutorial</a>, which incorporates Node.js, a local database, the Heroku platform, and a Slack webhook.</p><p>My version is a little different, as I use an API call to GET Chuck Norris jokes from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.icndb.com/">Internet Chuck Norris Database</a>.</p><p>You can check out my code in my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dwilcox8/norrisbot">Github Repo.</a></p>

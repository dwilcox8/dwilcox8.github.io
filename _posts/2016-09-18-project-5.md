description: <p>I began my first foray into mobile web development through BCIT course COMP 2052.</p><p>The first assignment required the use of <a target="_blank" href="https://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a>. The objective of the assignment was to create a jQuery Mobile client-side app that demonstrated a single page with a dropdown box, a map, and text that changed depending on your selection. The demo is being hosted in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dwilcox8/COMP1950-Final-Project">Github</a> in order to track changes.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="/comp2052/assign1/index.html"> Demo</a></p>

description: <p>iQmetrix gave me the initiative and flexibility to practice my web development skills. My first foray into web development was to update the landing page and layout for our <a href="http://developers.iqmetrix.com">developer portal</a>, where I made all of the changes and tweaks on our testing site using Github in order to prevent any issues on our production site. </p><p>I’m now continuing my task by helping update the layout. I am still new to layouts, and have combined in a couple of bootstrap template examples to help me learn. I have adapted these layouts to match the look and feel of the existing developer portal.</p><p>So far, I have put my skills into good use by following the flow of how real websites are designed. Starting with the basics of wireframing and Photoshop, I moved my way up using creative ways to adapt jQuery, CSS, and HTML into the website’s style.</p><p>I have also learned a lot about <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> for posts, as well simple scripting via the nunjucks and liquid templating engines.</p>

description: <p>For our 4th year project at Carleton University, our task was to demonstrate the capabilities of connecting a WiiMote to an RC car via Bluetooth. This project brought together many technologies, including an Arduino board to communicate with the WiiMote, and a breadboard for connecting the wiring between the Arduino and remote control to the RC truck. </p><p>You can see a video demonstation on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xkp_iJzlRGo">YouTube</a>.</p>
